    EXPLANATION: "The <b>Problem Sensing tool</b> is designed to help in the fist step of the Proposal Process.\
                  Its purpose is to collect and discuss <em>problems</em> that require <em>solutions</em>.\
                  Once the problems have been collected they will go through a process.\
                  AIM will have itâ€™s process but the idea is to have many community options that will flow into the proposal stage.\
                  Proposers will then use the <a href='https://www.notion.so/Proposer-Tool-86ef4b2455e044c58821f904eb911a49' target='_blank'>Proposal Tool</a> \
                  to explore existing problems or add new problems.",
